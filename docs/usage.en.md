# Usage

## Interactive Mode

```sh
wvl
```

Once in the TUI, type like a chat and press Enter to send. The agent autonomously invokes tools to read files, search code, edit, and run tests.

The prefix character at the beginning of each line tells you **who is speaking**:

| Prefix | Role | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `›` | You | Your message, in blue |
| `·` / spinner | Assistant | AI reply, in green, Markdown rendered |
| `·` / spinner | Thought | AI's reasoning, in gray, collapsed to one line when done (`Tab` to focus + `Enter` to expand) |
| `•` / spinner | Tool | AI's actions (read, write, run), green = success / red = failure |

**Keyboard shortcuts**:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Send message; type `exit` and Enter to quit |
| `Esc` | Interrupt running agent |
| `Esc+Esc` | Clear the input |
| `↑` `↓` / `PgUp` `PgDn` | Scroll conversation history |
| `Ctrl+E` / `End` | Jump to bottom |
| `Tab` | Focus next interactive paragraph (thought / tool output) |
| `Shift+Tab` | Focus previous interactive paragraph |
| `Enter` | Expand/collapse the currently focused paragraph |
| `Ctrl+G` | Toggle theme (dark / light / auto) |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit |
| `Shift + mouse drag` | Select text in terminal |

The **footer status bar** shows: current model, context usage (progress bar), cache hit rate, loop count, balance.

## One-shot

```sh
wvl "explain the design of pkg/llm/client.go"
wvl --model deepseek-v4-pro "write unit tests for UserService"
echo "review the code under pkg/llm/" | wvl
```

## Session Management

```sh
wvl ls                     # List recent sessions
wvl --continue             # Resume the most recent session
wvl --resume <session-id>  # Resume a specific session
```

## @ File References

Type `@` in the input to open a fuzzy file picker (prefix > substring matching). `Tab` enters subdirectories. Selected file contents are automatically injected into the message context.

### AGENTS.md Auto-loading

On startup, Waveloom discovers and loads `AGENTS.md` (search path: `~/.waveloom/AGENTS.md` → project root where `.git` lives → CWD), concatenating them from outer to inner as the first user message. The agent automatically follows project conventions, coding standards, and workflows defined therein.

### @ Expansion Inside AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` files also support `@` reference syntax, useful for splitting large convention docs into multiple files:

```
# AGENTS.md
@docs/coding-style.md
@docs/release-process.md
```

Waveloom expands `@` references within loaded AGENTS.md files. Multiple refs are expanded in order, with deduplication by path.
